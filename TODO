+ For more fair comparisons, have the CPU prettyprinting be
  standardized

+ Look into the lsl / lsr masking in store_byte on other arches

+ Look into using sliding window findstring from SPARC on other
	architectures
+ Look into function pointer rather than flag to ascii_to_num
	as done in SPARC

Suggestions from the web:

Stan Sieler <sieler _at_ allegro.com>
suggests Burroughs B1700 (later B1800, B1900) due to code density
from complicated microcode implementation (with multiple targets?)
